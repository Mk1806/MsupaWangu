    <h1> Ana itwa Stephen! </h1>
    <p> 
        He likes making fun of me. <br>
        He barely calls me by my name. <br>  
        He looks sexy in glasses btw.
    </p>

    <p> It's  funny I dont remember meeting him. <br>
        Prolly because I feel like he has been here all my life. <br>
        There isn't a moment he has missed. <br>
        Again that's what I feel.
    </p>
